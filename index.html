	 <li id="about"><b>About Us</b></li>
	  <p>
	   The Klutch x Eclipse Gaming Clan is a group of individuals that enjoy
	   gaming as a whole. We work together to help each other out if one of
	   us is having difficulty with something, as well as getting together
	   to play multiplayer games such as Call of Duty & Borderlands. Our goal
	   is to simply have fun and enjoy the games we play with the people we
	   play them with. Boy, Girl, Young, Old, Black, White, we don't care
	   about any of those so long as you play the game and are respectful to
	   other members. Even if you aren't "good" at a game, that's fine. We can
 	   help you get there so long as you let us.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	   The Clan was founded by <i>Klutch x BacoN</i> (leader) and <i>Klutch x Hazard</i>
	   (co-leader, formerly known as "Biohaz1346") when the two decided it would
	   be more fun to create a clan rather than try to find one that the two were
	   both happy with. Since then the clan has been a rather small group of close
	   individuals and friends. Our primary focus when it comes to gaming has been
	   on the <i>Call of Duty</i> (CoD) franchise. However we do play other games, we are
	   not a CoD-exclusive clan.

<blockquote><!--Additonal Table Info: Start-->
		   <p id="smallText">
		    The chart above is for games that we play as a group. Individual members may play other
			games and/or apps on their own. Our clan presence is more focused on MMO games rather
			than single-player games as well. This does not mean we won't play them, it just means
			that more members will play games like Call of Duty than Skyrim. We are more than happy
			to help each other with games that are not listed, however we may not play them as a group
			often if at all.
		   </p>
		   <p id="smallText">
		    With the games we play, we expect you to be mature enough and/or old enough to be playing
			the games based on the rating they have recieved from the ESRB. For example, if a game is
			rated "T - for Teen" we expect that you will be of at least 13 years of age and/or mature
			enough to play the game.
		   </p>
