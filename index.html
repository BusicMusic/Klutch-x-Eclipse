	  <p><div id="contentIndent">
	   The Klutch x Eclipse Gaming Clan is a group of individuals that enjoy gaming as a whole. We work together to help each other out if one of us is having difficulty with something, as well as getting together to play multiplayer games such as Call of Duty & Borderlands. Our goal is to simply have fun and enjoy the games we play with the people we play them with. Boy, Girl, Young, Old, Black, White, we don't care about any of those so long as you play the game and are respectful to other members. Even if you aren't "good" at a game, that's fine. We can help you get there so long as you let us.
	  </div></p>
	  <p><div id="contentIndent">
	   The Clan was founded by <i>Klutch x BacoN</i> (leader) and <i>Klutch x Hazard</i> (co-leader, formerly known as "Biohazard1346") when the two decided it would be more fun to create a clan rather than try to find one that the two were both happy with. Since then the clan has been a rather small group of close individuals and friends. Our primary focus when it comes to gaming has been on the <i>Call of Duty</i> (CoD) franchise. However we do play other games, we are not a CoD-exclusive clan.

		    The chart above is for games that we play as a group. Individual members may play other games and/or apps on their own. Our clan presence is more focused on FPS games rather than single-player games as well. This does not mean we won't play them, it just means that more members will play games like Call of Duty than Skyrim. We are more than happy to help each other with games that are not listed, however we may not play them as a group	often if at all.
		   </p></div>
		   <div id="contentIndent"><p id="smallText">
		    With the games we play, we expect you to be mature enough and/or old enough to be playing the games based on the rating they have recieved from the ESRB. For example, if a game is rated "T - for Teen" we expect that you will be of at least 13 years of age and/or mature enough to play the game.

   A special thanks to:
    <br/> Amanda DiMaso, a Science Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for making ecology a more interesting topic as well as giving examples as to how it applies to the real world even if you don't pursure the science field.
    <br/> Mr. Saunders, an Art Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for teaching me the basics of using Photoshop and Graphical Arts.
    <br/> Joe Dwyer, a Computer Information Science Teacher at ECPI University, for teaching the class that I learned how to code web pages using HTML in as well as answering any and all questions I had about the subject.
    <br/> Thomas Huss, a History Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for being one of the few teachers I wanted to hang out with outside of class, and for writing a letter of recommendation to ECPI for me.

    <br/> Allan Hinman, an English Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for being "infamous" among the students for treating all his senior students like actual adults. Although it could be anoying at times, I appreciated it.
