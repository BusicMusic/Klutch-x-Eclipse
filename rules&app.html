<h2>Rule List & Application Outline</h2>
    <ul>
<div><!--Rule List: Start-->
	<li id="rules"><b>Rules</b></li>
	 <ol>
	  <li><b>Swearing</b>
	   <div id="contentIndent">
	    Swearing <i>is</i> permitted. <i>However</i>, please keep it to a minimum. If it gets to the point where every other word you say is a swear, then you will be asked to calm it down a bit.
	   </div>
	  </li><br/>
	  <li><b>Age</b>
	   <div id="contentIndent">
	    We do not have an age requirement, so long as you're mature enough to play the game and can communicate well with other players. Whether you're 10 years young or 80 years old, as long as you can keep up with the rest of us in terms of gameplay and lingo it's all the same to us.
	   </div>
	  </li><br/>
	  <li><b>Conflict</b>
	   <div id="contentIndent">
	    If you have a problem with someone, solve it yourselves. Don't just ignore each other like children. Bad blood between players doesn't help anyone play games any better. If the problem is more serious than just a heated argument, then tell one of the Leaders or Co-Leaders. They will handle it as they see fit.<br/><i>Once a problem is solved, it is <u>finished</u>. Bury the hatchet and move on. Do <u>not</u> keep bringing it up in the future.</i>
	   </div>
	  </li><br/>
	  <li><b>Respect & Attention</b>
	   <div id="contentIndent">
	    We <i>are</i> a rather laid back group, but when a Leader or a Co-Leader is trying to be serious and needs your attention and/or your respect, you are expected to give it to them. This may happen during a game when strategy is being discussed or when we are just having a meeting/discussion about something that requires our attention.
	   </div>
	  </li><br/>
	  <li><b>Personal Views</b>
	   <div id="contentIndent">
 	    We do not tolerate racists or sexists. If you're either, refrain from making such comments to the rest of the group. You can do what you want on your own time when we aren't playing as a group.
	   </div>
	  </li><br/>
	 </ol>
</div>
<!--Rule List: End-->

<div><!--Requirements: Start-->
	<li id="reqs"><b>Requirements for Joining</b></br></li>
	 <ol>
	  <li><b>A Stable Internet Connection:</b><br/>
	   <div id="contentIndent">
	    This is a simple must-have if you intend to play <i>any</i> multiplayer games with the group. If you're interenet goes down frequently, or you lag around the maps, a Leader or Co-Leader will make a decision based on how often this happens. This can be simple like urging you to fix it if you can, or having to kick you out if it gets to the point where it's impossible to play games with you online.
	   </div></li><br/>
	  <li><b>K/D Ratio:</b><br/>
	  <div id="contentIndent">
	   To join our group and be eligible to play multiplayer FPS games, you must have at least a 1.0 kill/death ratio in at least two of the FPS games we play. It doesn't matter which two. Unless instructed otherwise by a Leader or a Co-Leader, this is a necessity for joining and playing FPS games like CoD and BF.
	   </div></li><br/>
	  <li><b>A Basic Understanding:</b><br/>
	  <div id="contentIndent">
	   Although we encourage members of the group to help each other out on games that someone has questions about, we aren't an interactive tutorial. "A Basic Understanding" simply refers to things like movement & interaction controls, how to access certian menues (inventories, maps, pause screen, etc.), and other miscellaneous things like that. If the tutorial for the game covers it, we expect you to know it.
	  </div></li><br/>
	  <li><b>A Microphone/Headset:</b><br/>
	  <div id="contentIndent">
	    • For <i>console</i> games you must have a headset in order to communicate. It's far too impractical to communicate in games like Dark Souls with things like "roll for yes and backstep for no".
	   <br/></br/>
	    • For <i>computer</i> games, depending on the game you may or may not need a headset if it has a chatbox already in-game and is easy to type while playing the game. However, if you are playing with other members who are using mics to communicate, then it is highly recomended to sit in the chat room so you can at least hear them even if you won't be speaking to them. If the game does not have a chatbox, then a microphone or a headset will be required.
	   </div></li><br/>
	   <li><b>A Good Way to Communicate</b></li>
	    <div id="contentIndent">
		 Not including the requirement for communication in-game, you also need a way to communicate with our members. This is used to coordinate with other members to decide on what time to play games as a group, and simply getting to know each other better and making lasting friendships.
		 Kik is <i>highly recomended</i> since it's easy to create a group chat with all our members and doesnt come across as being as personal as your phone number.

   A special thanks to:
    <br/> Amanda DiMaso, a Science Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for making ecology a more interesting topic as well as giving examples as to how it applies to the real world even if you don't pursure the science field.
    <br/> Mr. Saunders, an Art Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for teaching me the basics of using Photoshop and Graphical Arts.
    <br/> Joe Dwyer, a Computer Information Science Teacher at ECPI University, for teaching the class that I learned how to code web pages using HTML in as well as answering any and all questions I had about the subject.
    <br/> Thomas Huss, a History Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for being one of the few teachers I wanted to hang out with outside of class, and for writing a letter of recommendation to ECPI for me.

    <br/> Allan Hinman, an English Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for being "infamous" among the students for treating all his senior students like actual adults. Although it could be anoying at times, I appreciated it.
