<h3>Welcome to the official clan page for Klutch x Eclipse</h3>
<div class="content">
<h2>Rule List & Application Outline</h2>
    <ul>
<div><!--Rule List: Start-->
	<li id="rules"><b>Rules</b></li>
	 <ol>
	  <li>
	   Swearing <i>is</i> permitted. <b>However</b>, please keep it to a minimum. If it
	   gets to the point where every other word you say is a swear, then you will 
	   be asked to calm it down a bit.
	  </li><br/>
	  <li>
	   We do not have an age requirement, so long as you're mature enough to play the game
	   and can communicate well with other players. Whether you're 10 years young or 80 years
	   old, as long as you can keep up with the rest of us in terms of gameplay and lingo
	   it's all the same to us.
	  </li><br/>
	  <li>
	   If you have a problem with someone, solve it yourselves. Don't just ignore eachother like
	   children. Bad blood between players doesn't help anyone play games any better. If the problem
	   is more serious than just a heated argument, then tell one of the Leaders or Co-Leaders. They
	   will handle it as they see fit.<br/><i>Once a problem is solved, it is <b>finished</b>. Bury the
	   hatchet and move on. Do <b>not</b> keep bringing it up in the future.</i>
	  </li><br/>
	  <li>
	   We <i>are</i> a rather laid back group, but when a Leader or a Co-Leader is trying to
	   be serious and needs your attention and/or your respect, you are expected to give it to
	   them. This may happen during a game when strategy is being discussed or when we are
	   just having a meeting/discussion about something that requires out attention.
	  </li><br/>
	 </ol>

      Please include your reason for wanting to join our group as well as your
	  <u>real name & your username</u> in addition to what console(s) you intend to be playing
	  with our group on. Your real name will not be shared outside of the Leaders and Co-Leaders
	  if you specify that you would like that to be the case. Otherwise we may call you by your
	  real name as well as your username during games. We tend to use the two interchangably.

   Brendon Busic with assistance from Isaiah Core. The background image has been taken from
   Google.com by searching "eclipse" under images. I do not own that image in any way. Nor do
   I in any way own any of the rights to the games that are listed on this site, or the

   A special thanks to Joe Dwyer, a teacher at ECPI University, for teaching the class that I
   learned how to code web pages using HTML in as well as answering any and all questions I had
   about the subject.
