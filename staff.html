   Website for the Klutch x Eclipse gaming group. All the content is made and upkept by
   Brendon Busic with assistance from Isaiah Core. The background image has been taken from
   Google.com by searching "eclipse" under images. I do not own that image in any way. Nor do
   I in any way own any of the rights to the games that are listed on this site, or the
   companies that do own the games. This site was made using Notepad++ in combination with
   the HTML Programming skills that I have obtained from ECPI University.

   A special thanks to Joe Dwyer, a teacher at ECPI University, for teaching the class that I
   learned how to code web pages using HTML in as well as answering any and all questions I had
   about the subject.
