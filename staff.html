   Website for the Klutch x Eclipse gaming group. All the content is made and upkept by Brendon Busic with assistance from Isaiah Core. The background image has been taken from Google.com by searching "eclipse" under images. I do not own that image in any way. Nor do I in any way own any of the rights to the games that are listed on this site, or the companies that do own the games. This site was made using Notepad++ in combination with the HTML Programming skills that I have obtained from ECPI University.

   A special thanks to:
    <br/> Amanda DiMaso, a Science Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for making ecology a more interesting topic as well as giving examples as to how it applies to the real world even if you don't pursure the science field.
    <br/> Mr. Saunders, an Art Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for teaching me the basics of using Photoshop and Graphical Arts.
    <br/> Joe Dwyer, a Computer Information Science Teacher at ECPI University, for teaching the class that I learned how to code web pages using HTML in as well as answering any and all questions I had about the subject.
    <br/> Thomas Huss, a History Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for being one of the few teachers I wanted to hang out with outside of class, and for writing a letter of recommendation to ECPI for me.
    <br/> David Pienkowski, a Programming & Math Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for teaching the programming classes I took in high school that helped me get a leg up in my programming career, and for writing a letter of recommendation to ECPI for me.
    <br/> Allan Hinman, an English Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for being "infamous" among the students for treating all his senior students like actual adults. Although it could be anoying at times, I appreciated it.
	<br/> Daniel Turner, a Math Teacher at Patrick Henry High School, for making Algebra II more interesting than most math classes are, as well engaging the class in numerous lessons.
